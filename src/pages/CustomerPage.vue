            <p>
                Now more than ever, corporations are investing heavily in IT. The quality of these investments affects the daily work of millions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yet it’s not uncommon to see industry surveys where the failure rates for IT projects is over 50%. It’s possible to do better and it’s possible to do so consistently. Use the Business Model Canvas to focus your company strategy and facilitate buy-in from stakeholders.

                In this two-week course, we’ll step through major challenges within corporate IT and how to address them with the disciplined use of design thinking, Lean Startup, and agile as a team framework.
            </p>
            <p>
                Translate your work on the Canvas to specific charters in IT. Rapidly prototype strategically-aligned processes for implementation within your IT infrastructure. How do you define a customer-centric strategy you can actually execute? To do strategic IT, you’ve got to have a strategy! Ideally, you need one that’s easy to understand and use as a clear basis for action.

            <p>
                That’s what you’ll learn in this course.

                A Short Description
            </h3>
            <p>
                A customer-centric way of doing business is a way that provides a positive customer experience before and after the sale in order to drive repeat business, enhance customer loyalty and improve business growth.
            </p>
            <p>
                But, a customer-centric company is more than a company that offers good service. Both Amazon and Zappos are prime examples of brands that are customer-centric and have spent years creating a culture around the customer and their needs. Their commitment to delivering customer value is genuine – In fact, Zappos is happy to fire employees if they do not fit within their customer-centric culture!
            </p>
            <p>
                But, how important is being customer-centric? The good news is that’s becoming very important! Econsultancy recently asked what the most important characteristic is in order to establish a truly “digital-native” culture. The answer to that question and leading the responses with 58% was to be customer-centric.
